# Algorithms-Visualizer
A web app that allows you to explore path-finding and sorting algorithms with visualization. On the path-finding page, it's using **Dijkstra** algorithms for finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. On the sorting page, you can choose from **bubble sort** and **selection sort** algorithms for sorting an array of numbers.

This project is deployed on [https://algorithms-visualizer-ten.vercel.app/](https://algorithms-visualizer-ten.vercel.app/)
