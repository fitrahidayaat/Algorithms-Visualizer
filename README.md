# Algorithms-Visualizer
A web app that allows you to explore path-finding and sorting algorithms with visualization.

This project is deployed on [https://algorithms-visualizer-ten.vercel.app/](https://algorithms-visualizer-ten.vercel.app/)
## Path-finding
Visualizing how breadth-first search work in solving the shortest path in non-weighted graph problem, with graph represented by grid matrix.

## Sorting
Visualizing how **bubble sort** and **selection sort** algorithm works for sorting an array of numbers.

## Installation
